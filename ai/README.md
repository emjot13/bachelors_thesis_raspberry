This project lets you monitor your fatigue level by recognisizing the frequency of yawning and closing eyes for longer than a certain threshold.
You can easily configure the script for your needs, some of the options include:
- verbose mode - you can choose whether to open a window with the real-time camera output
- audio mode - if you want to hear an alarm when you close your eyes for longer than a specified threshold
- writing to a file mode - if you want to write the statistics to a file

And a few more - just run the script with --help or -help flag to get all the info

In the future I might make it more user friendly by implementing a GUI and making it an exe file.

But for now to use the script you need to:
1. clone this repository
2. move to the cloned directory
3. run command pip install -r requirements.txt (don't worry if it takes quite a while, just be patient :D )
4. run command python main.py
5. Enjoy!

For more information on the project you can read a PDF file where I shortly descibed all the proccess (in Polish).
